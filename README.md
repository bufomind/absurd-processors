# Absurd Processors

Introduces five new processors to [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master). 
Writing logic is most of the fun for me and I was running into speed/range limitations.
Here is my attempt at remediating my issues in a balanced and non-balanced way.
Enjoy the sound effects.
Pull requests welcome.

I made the sprites, use them however you want, though a star on the repo and an acknowledgment would be appreciated.

> This does not affect my game performance though I am on a powerful machine. It may discernibly impact less powerful machines.

## Absurd Processor

Relatively balanced, next generation processor.
3x faster, 3x more health, and 33 more range than the Hyper Processor.
Requires 3x the resources, 3x the Cryofluid, and ♾️x the Plastanium (for the nice green color).

## Bizarre Processor

Relatively balanced processor straight from the research lab.
Titanium antenna extends range to the entire map.
3x more health, 3x the cost, and the same speed as the Hyper Processor.

## Eyeball Processor

No link is too far.
No damage is too high.

Faster than the Logic Processor, slower than the Hyper Processor.
Covers the entire map regardless of placement.
Costs a penny.


## Planet Processor

All lands are charted and all threats are thwarted.

2x faster than the Hyper Processor.
Covers the entire map regardless of placement.
Costs a penny.


## Clown Processor

Honk Honk.
The clown sees all and refuses to die.

5x faster than the Hyper Processor.
Covers the entire map regardless of placement.
Costs a penny.

## Goals

### The Preposterous Processor

Covers the entire map in a balanced way.
Probably 3x speed of the Hyper Processor.
At least 5x5.
