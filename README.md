# Absurd Processors

Introduces two new processors to [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master). 
Writing logic is most of the fun for me and I was running into speed/range limitations.
Here is my attempt at remediating my issues in a balanced and non-balanced way.
Enjoy the sound effects.
Pull requests welcome.

I made the sprites, use them however you want, though a star on the repo and an acknowledgment would be appreciated.

> This does not affect my game performance though I am on a powerful machine. It may discernibly impact less powerful machines.

## Absurd Processor

Relatively balanced, next generation processor.
3x faster, 3x more health, and 33 more range than the Hyper Processor.
Requires 3x the resources, 3x the Cryofluid, and ♾️x the Plastanium (for the nice green color).

## Clown Processor

Honk Honk.
The clown sees all and refuses to die.

5x faster than the Hyper Processor.
Covers the entire map regardless of placement.
Costs a penny.

## Goals

### The Preposterous Processor

Covers the entire map in a balanced way.
Probably 5x speed of the Hyper Processor.
At least 5x5.
